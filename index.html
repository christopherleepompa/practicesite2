					<p>Hello! My name is Christopher Pompa and I am a graduating Senior at George Mason University's film program with a Concentration in Production and Post-Production. I set up this website both as part of an assignment for my web design class, but my true passion is editing film. Through my four year collegiate career I have assisted with and been in charge of editing several projects both inside and outside the curriculum. I also have experience in several other aspects of film production as well, which would make me a valuable asset to any crew. If you would like to know more about me, visit any one of the links above and they will take you to their respective pages.</p>
